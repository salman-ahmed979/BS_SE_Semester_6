Comments (a.k.a. Deodorant):

// Function to perform the summation of array values
int value(int[] arr)
{	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)	
		sum += arr[i];
	return sum;
}

-- Refactor by Rename Method

int getArraySummation(int[] arr)
{	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)	
		sum += arr[i];
	return sum;
}

Summary: Here we have method named "value" which is ambigious and doesnot provide any meaning
so, we provide the comments. However, when we refactor, we rename method to "getArraySummation" 
that clearly tells what the method performs.
